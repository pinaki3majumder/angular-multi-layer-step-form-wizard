# MultiLayerStepFormWizard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.

## Overview
This project implements a dynamic multi-layer step form using Angular 17.2.1. The form fields, validation rules, and steps are dynamically generated based on a JSON configuration, with support for nested multi-step forms within a single step. This allows for complex form structures with dynamic rendering.

## Features
- **Dynamic Form Rendering**: The entire form is rendered dynamically based on a JSON configuration file.
- **Multi-Layer Steps**: The form is divided into multiple steps with navigation between them.
- **Nested Multi-Step Forms**: One or more steps can contain additional multi-step forms, creating a nested step form structure.
- **Validation**: Each step, including nested forms, has client-side validation using Angularâ€™s reactive forms.
- **Reusability**: This form can be reused for various scenarios by updating the JSON configuration.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: Version 17.2.1
- **Reactive Forms**: For managing form control, form group, and validation.
- **TypeScript**: The project is written in TypeScript.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For styling the form components.
